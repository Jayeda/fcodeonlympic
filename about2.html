        <h1>About Easter</h1>
      <p>Easter is the most important festival in the Christian calendar. John 11:25-26: "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?'" 1 Peter 1:3: "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!The exact origins of the Easter bunny are clouded in mystery. One theory is that the symbol of the rabbit stems from pagan tradition, specifically the festival of Eostreâ€”a goddess of fertility whose animal symbol was a bunny. Rabbits, known for their energetic breeding, have traditionally symbolized fertility.
